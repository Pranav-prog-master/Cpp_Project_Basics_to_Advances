## ðŸŒŸ About The Game

This project is a simple yet engaging number guessing game written in C. The computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and your challenge is to guess it in the fewest attempts possible. With each guess, the program will guide you, telling you whether your guess is too high or too low.
It's a perfect little puzzle to take a break, reset your focus, and enjoy a moment of simple, creative problem-solving.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Play

1.  **Run the program.**
2.  You'll be prompted to enter a guess between 1 and 100.
3.  The program will give you a hint:
    - `Guess a larger number.`
    - `Guess a smaller number.`
4.  Use the hints to narrow down your next guess.
5.  Keep guessing until you find the correct number! The game will celebrate your victory and tell you how many attempts it took.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Compile and Run

This project is written in C and can be compiled with any standard C compiler like GCC.

1.  **Save the code** into a file named `guessing_game.c`.
2.  **Open your terminal** or command prompt.
3.  **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the file.
4.  **Compile the code** using the following command:
    ```bash
    g++ guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
    ```
5.  **Run the executable**:
    -   On Windows: `.\guessing_game.exe`
    -   On Linux/macOS: `./guessing_game`

Enjoy the puzzle!

# ðŸ§  DAY-02 :- Simple Console Calculator
A classic, straightforward console calculator built to demonstrate fundamental programming principles in different languages. This project provides a clean, easy-to-understand implementation of basic arithmetic operations.

---

## ðŸŒŸ About This Project
This repository contains the source code for a simple command-line calculator. The goal is to perform basic math functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's an excellent project for beginners to understand core programming concepts like user input, control flow, and functions.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple menu-driven system for easy operation.
- Core Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Error Handling: Includes basic checks, such as for division by zero.
- Cross-Platform: Designed to be compiled and run on any system with a standard compiler.

---

## ðŸš€ Versions
This project is available in three different programming languages:

C++ Version
The C++ version introduces object-oriented principles. The logic is encapsulated within a Calculator class, and it uses C++ streams (iostream) for input and output, showcasing a more modern approach to the same problem.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Please refer to the source code file for your language of choice for specific compilation and execution instructions.
For C: g++ 02_Simple_Calculator.cpp -o clock && ./clock

---


# ðŸ§  DAY-03 :- Digital Clock Console Application
A classic and elegant digital clock implemented in the console. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of time handling and continuous updates in three different programming languages in C. 

---

## ðŸŒŸ About This Project
This repository contains a simple yet functional digital clock that displays the current time and date directly in your terminal. The clock updates every second, providing a live feed of the current time. It's an excellent project for understanding time libraries, loops, and cross-platform console manipulation.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-Time Display: Shows the current time, updating every second.
- Date Display: Shows the current date, including the day of the week.
- Customizable Time Format: Users can choose between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats at the start.
- Cross-Platform: Designed to run on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS).

---

## ðŸš€ Versions
This project is available in three different programming languages, each showcasing a unique approach:

C Version
A lightweight and efficient implementation using a procedural approach. It relies on the standard <time.h> library for all time-related functions and uses conditional compilation for cross-platform compatibility.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
For each version, you will need the appropriate compiler (GCC for C/C++, JDK for Java). You can compile and run the source file from your terminal.
For C++: g++ 03_DigitalClock.cpp -o clock && ./clock

# ðŸ§  DAY-04: Terminal Progress Bar

A simple yet visually satisfying terminal-based progress bar implemented in **Java**. This project demonstrates how to update console output dynamically and is perfect for learning about loops, formatting, and time delays across languages.

---

## ðŸŒŸ About This Project

This repository contains source code for a basic progress bar that updates in real-time on the terminal. Itâ€™s designed to help beginners understand how to manipulate console output and simulate task progress in different programming environments.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Dynamic Console Output: Real-time progress updates using loops and formatted strings  
- Adjustable Speed: Delay intervals can be modified to simulate different task durations  
- Cross-Language Comparison: See how similar logic is implemented in C, C++, and Java  
- Minimal Dependencies: Uses only standard libraries for portability and simplicity  

---

## ðŸš€ Versions

Java Version : Implements the progress bar using `System.out.printf()` and `Thread.sleep()` for smooth console updates.

---

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

Refer to the source code files for each language. Below are sample compilation and execution commands:
For Cpp: g++ 04_Progress.c -o progress && ./progress
